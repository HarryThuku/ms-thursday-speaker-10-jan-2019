# Binary exploitation example
- in this very simple example you are given a [binary file]() / executable program thats asks for a licence key which you dont know, also assuming you dont have access to the original C source code.
- In this case examining ascii strings of the binary file reveals the key
```bash
strings licence_1
```
- A better and recommended way to solve this challenge would be to use [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to disassemble the binary file to see how it works, you immeadiately notice that it compares your input with a value in memory.

```assembly
   0x0000000000400602 <+69>:	call   0x4004b0 <strcmp@plt>
```
